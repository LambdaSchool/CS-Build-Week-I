      <h3>History - Technical Details</h3>
      <h5>1940</h5>
      <p>
        John von Neumann defined life as a creation (as a being or organism)
        which can reproduce itself and simulate a Turing machine.
      </p>
      <h5>1968</h5>
      <p>
        John Conway began doing experiments with a variety of different 2D
        cellular automaton rules. Conway's initial goal was to define an
        interesting and unpredictable cell automaton.
      </p>
      <h5>1970</h5>
      <p>
        The game made its first public appearance in the October issue of
        Scientific American, in Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Games" column. In
        this respect, it foreshadowed the later popularity of computer-generated
        fractals. For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way
        to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles
      </p>
      <h5>1970 and beyond</h5>
      <p>
        Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow
        indefinitelyâ€”i.e., that for any initial configuration with a finite
        number of living cells, the population cannot grow beyond some finite
        upper limit. In the game's original appearance in "Mathematical Games",
        Conway offered a prize of fifty dollars to the first person who could
        prove or disprove the conjecture before the end of 1970
