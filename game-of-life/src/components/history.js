          Cellular automata are programs that operate on data which is typically stored in a grid. Typically, this grid is 2D, but it could be represented in any dimensions.

          The Game of Life is a cellular automaton developed by John Horton Conway in 1970.

          The game itself runs automatically requiring no further input from the time it is started. From then, observing the patterns that emerge or setting up the grid to a desired initial state can be ways in which the game can be enjoyed.

          In essence, this game is Turing complete, as it is capable of performing arbitrary, general purpose computationâ€” although it may be impractical, it is theoretically possible to compute anything in a large enough grid and given enough time using the Game of Life.
